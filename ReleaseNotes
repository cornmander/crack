    -   Added support for exception handling, converted the library to use 
        exceptions instead of the crack.exp.error module.
    -   Added support for compiling scripts to native binaries.
    -   Added syntax to allow initialization of sequence types, e.g. 
        array[int] a = [1, 2, 3];
    -   Improved string interpolation, added calls to enter() and leave() and
        made it a true expression returning the return value of leave() or the 
        target object if leave() is undefined.  Implemented a StringFormatter 
        variation that can be used in an expression context.
    -   Added the "encoding" annotation, allowing users to declare a script's 
        encoding.

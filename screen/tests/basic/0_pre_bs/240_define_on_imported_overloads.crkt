# This verifies that we get an error when defining a variable that is an
# imported overload.  This usage is disallowed because it constrains the
# author of the module from which the overload is imported from making changes
# to the order of the function definitions for the overload since, for
# example, "g := f" creates a variable referencing the first defined overload.

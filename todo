-   Reference counted objects
    -   Object base class
    -   implicit call to "bind()" before return and on assignment of a 
        variable value
    -   implicit call to "release()" for all intermediate objects
    
-   cleanup:
    -   need to be able to define "oper" funcs.  Make "release", "init" and 
        "bind" oper funcs.
-   function arguments are currently SSA values, which means this won't work:
    type func(int a) { a = 100; }
-   nested compilation so I can write lots of unit tests (shell scripted unit 
    tests are working just fine)

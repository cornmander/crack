-   in optimized mode, example/while.crk triggers a SIGSEGV (looks like 
    parseExpression() is parsing an integer and then somehow returning the 
    null expression from the end anyway)
-   function arguments are currently SSA values, which means this won't work:
    type func(int a) { a = 100; }

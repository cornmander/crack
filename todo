-   function arguments are currently SSA values, which means this won't work:
    type func(int a) { a = 100; }
-   nested compilation so I can write lots of unit tests
-   simple operations (integer arithmetic)
-   as it stands, VarRef uses VarDef.impl to emit reference/assign for 
    different variable scopes.  This doesn't work for field variables, where 
    we need to use a different type of VarRef.
